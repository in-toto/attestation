# Java implementation of in-toto attestations

This package contains Java bindings for in-toto/attestation. Its contents
are autogenerated using
[protobuf definitions](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/tree/main/protos).

For more information, see the
[in-toto Attestation Framework](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation).

## Versioning

At the moment, this library is versioned <1.0 as we work towards stabilizing
the protobuf definitions and the available predicates.
