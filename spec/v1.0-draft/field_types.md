# Field type definitions

<a id="DigestSet"></a>
_DigestSet (object)_

> Set of alternative cryptographic digests for a single software artifact,
> expressed as a JSON map from algorithm name to lowercase hex-encoded value.
> Usually there is just a single key/value pair, but multiple entries MAY be
> used for algorithm agility.
>
> It is RECOMMENDED to use at least `sha256` for compatibility between
> producers and consumers.
>
> Pre-defined algorithms:
>
> -   `sha256`, `sha224`, `sha384`, `sha512`, `sha512_224`, `sha512_256`,
>     `sha3_224`, `sha3_256`, `sha3_384`, `sha3_512`, `shake128`, `shake256`,
>     `blake2b`, `blake2s`, `ripemd160`, `sm3`, `gost`, `sha1`, `md5`
>
>     Standard cryptographic hash algorithms, for cases when the method
>     of serialization is obvious or well known.
>
> -   `goModuleH1`: The go module [directory Hash1][], omitting the "h1:"
>     prefix and output in hexadecimal instead of base64. Can be computed
>     over a directory named `name@version`, or the contents of zip file
>     containing such a directory:
>
>     ```bash
>     find name@version -type f | LC_ALL=C sort | xargs -r sha256sum | sha256sum | cut -f1 -d' '
>     ```
>
>     For example, the module dirhash
>     `h1:47DEQpj8HBSa+/TImW+5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU=` would be encoded as
>     `{"goModuleH1": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"}`.
>
> Consumers MUST only accept algorithms that they consider secure and MUST
> ignore unrecognized or unaccepted algorithms. For example, most applications
> SHOULD NOT accept "md5" because it lacks collision resistance.
>
> Two DigestSets SHOULD be considered matching if ANY acceptable field
> matches.
>
> Examples:
>
> -   `{"sha256": "abcd", "sha512": "1234"}` matches `{"sha256": "abcd"}`
> -   `{"sha256": "abcd"}` does not match `{"sha256": "fedb", "sha512": "abcd"}`
> -   `{"somecoolhash": "abcd"}` uses a non-predefined algorithm

<a id="Reference"></a>
_Reference (object)_

> A size-efficient representation of any hashable artifact referenced by
> another in-toto attestation.
>
> Schema:
>
>```jsonc
> {
>   "localName": "<NAME>",
>   "digest": { "<ALGORITHM>": "<HEX VALUE>", ... },
>   "downloadLocation": "<RESOURCE URI>", // optional
>   "mimeType": "<MIME TYPE>" // optional
> }
>```
>
> Fields:
>
> -   `localName` (_string, required_): Human-readable identifier to
>     distinguish the referenced artifact locally. The semantics are up to
>     the producer and consumer.
> -   `digest` (_[DigestSet], required_): The producer and consumer must
>     agree on acceptable algorithms.
> -   `downloadLocation` (_[ResourceURI], optional_): The location of the
>     referenced artifact. To enable automated downloads by consumers, the
>     specified location SHOULD be resolvable.
> -   `mimeType` (_string, optional_): The [MIME Type][] (i.e., media type)
>     of the referenced artifact.
>
> Note: A reference is bound to the `digest` field. All other fields are
> informational.
>
> Example:
>
> ```jsonc
> { 
>   "localName": "gcc9.3.0-rebuilderd-attestation",
>   "digest": { "sha256": "abcdabcde..." },
>   "downloadLocation": "http://example.com/rebuilderd-instance/gcc_9.3.0-1ubuntu2_amd64.att",
>   "mimeType": "application/vnd.in-toto+json"
> }
> ```

<a id="ResourceURI"></a>
_ResourceURI (string)_

> Uniform Resource Identifier as specified in [RFC 3986][], used to identify
> and locate a software artifact. Case sensitive and MUST be case normalized
> as per section 6.2.2.1 of RFC 3986, meaning that the scheme and authority
> MUST be in lowercase.
>
> SHOULD resolve to the artifact, but MAY be unresolvable. It is RECOMMENDED
> to use [Package URL][] (`pkg:`) or [SPDX Download Location][] (e.g.
> `git+https:`).
>
> Example: `"pkg:deb/debian/stunnel@5.50-3?arch=amd64"`.

<a id="TypeURI"></a>
_TypeURI (string)_

> Uniform Resource Identifier as specified in [RFC 3986][], used as a
> collision-resistant type identifier. Case sensitive and MUST be case
> normalized as per section 6.2.2.1 of RFC 3986, meaning that the scheme and
> authority MUST be in lowercase.
>
> SHOULD resolve to a human-readable description, but MAY be unresolvable.
> SHOULD include a version number to allow for revisions.
>
> TypeURIs are not registered. The natural namespacing of URIs is sufficient
> to prevent collisions.
>
> Example: `"https://in-toto.io/Statement/v1"`.

<a id="Timestamp"></a>
_Timestamp (string)_

> A point in time, represented as a string in [RFC 3339][] format in the UTC
> timezone ("Z").
>
> Example: `"1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z"`.
