    # There are two reasons we may need to regenerate libraries.
    # First, there's an explicit change merged into main. That's caught by the
    # other trigger. The second reason is when protoc is updated to a newer
    # version (still within the versions specified here, as 3.x may map to 3.20
    # instead of 3.19) without any changes to the main branch of this
    # repository. For this reason, the second trigger runs this workflow once a
    # week.
